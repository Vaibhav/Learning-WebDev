# Rails Notes

1. Generate the rails framework
2. Generate a controller
3. Generate the index 
4. Create a route

To show all the routes a user can take

        rake routes



* Relationships between classes
    * has_many 
    * belongs_to 


Examples: 

**has\_many** with a **belongs\_to** is called a _one-to-many relationship_, because one Category can have many Listings, but a Listing can have at most one Category.
