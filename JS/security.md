// Snyk offers both a command-line tool and a Github integration that checks your application against Snykâ€™s open source vulnerability database for any known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. Install the CLI as follows:
npm install -g snyk
snyk test

// Use this command to open a wizard that walks you through the process of applying updates or patches to fix the vulnerabilities that were found:
snyk wizard
```
