# Notes from You Don't Know JS

```js
var obj = {
	a: "hello world",
	b: 42
};

var b = "a";

obj[b];			// "hello world"
obj["b"];		// 42
```


To round a float point number use **toFixed(numbersAfterDecimal)**


Here's an example of *explicit* coercion:

```js
var a = "42";

var b = Number( a );

a;				// "42"
b;				// 42 -- the number!
```

And here's an example of *implicit* coercion:

```js
var a = "42";

var b = a * 1;	// "42" implicitly coerced to 42 here

a;				// "42"
b;				// 42 -- the number!
```

`==` checks for value equality with coercion allowed, and `===` checks for value equality without allowing coercion; `===` is often called "strict equality" for this reason.

Consider the implicit coercion that's allowed by the `==` loose-equality comparison and not allowed with the `===` strict-equality:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = 42;

a == b;			// true
a === b;		// false
```

* If either value (aka side) in a comparison could be the `true` or `false` value, avoid `==` and use `===`.
* If either value in a comparison could be of these specific values (`0`, `""`, or `[]` -- empty array), avoid `==` and use `===`.
* In *all* other cases, you're safe to use `==`. Not only is it safe, but in many cases it simplifies your code in a way that improves readability.
